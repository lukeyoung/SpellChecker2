#SpellerChecker Program by Luke Young

This project is meant to demonstrate an algorithm I wrote, which takes a misspelled word and suggests 
possible correct spellings. It is a C# console application. When you run the code in Program.cs a 
console window opens and the user is prompted to enter a word. The program then outputs suggested spellings.

The inspiration for this project came when I read about a programming competition where participants 
had to create a SpellChecker. The core of this program is the WordChecker Class. The constructor 
creates a dictionary of all known correctly spelled words. The CompileErrata method searches through 
a text file that lists common misspellings. The method creates a list of substitutions that turn a 
misspelled word into a non-misspelled word. It also keeps track if a certain substitution works for 
multiple words. A list of all substitutions is saved to the output.txt file in the root. The 
checkWord method takes a misspelled word and cycles through the list of substitutions seeing if it 
can create a real word. The program will try up to three different combinations of substitutions. 
I’m proud of this program because it’s a neat solution to an interesting problem!
